# Problem Explanation 🔢🔡🔠

This program takes a string from the user and counts the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in it:

- The program asks the user to enter a string.
- It calculates and prints:
  - The total length of the string.
  - The number of uppercase (capital) letters.
  - The number of lowercase (small) letters.
- Other characters (like spaces, numbers, or symbols) are ignored in the letter count.

**Example:**  
If the user enters:  
`Hello World!`  
The output will be:  
```
String Length = 12
Capital Letter count = 2
Small Letter count = 8
```

This is useful for analyzing the composition of any text and knowing how many capital or small letters it contains. 🧐📝
